# My-Tutoring-Data-Analysis

I teach a lot of math, chemistry and physics at both the high-school and university level. While I lived in Calgary the past few months, I worked more or less full-time tutoring and ended up logging quite a number of hours over a 3 or so month span. This project uses my scraped Google Calendar data which includes quite basic quantities like:

- title of the calendar event (usually something like, "TUTOR BRIAN" if BRIAN was one of my students)
- full date of session
- day of the week of the session (Sunday, Tuesday, etc)
- duration of session

I will map the courses of each student to their events at some point as this was not something I recorded in the calendar at the time. I import and clean the data up, then perform some EDA.
